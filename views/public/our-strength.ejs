                                        are organized on regular basis, to give the students a tough drilling to appear in the Competitive Exams. Previous Years Question Papers are attempted by the aspirants and follow up work is also monitored by the
                                        teachers to ensure that ample practice is taken up by them. Group Discussions and Debating Sessions are a customary feature to augment communication skills of the aspirants, as we believe that great leaders need
                                        to be great orators as well. One- to- one Counseling Sessions are taken up to bring about clarity and transparency in the cadets as far as their choices, doubts and caliber is concerned. Training modules are designed
