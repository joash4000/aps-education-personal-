                                    <p>Experienced Mentors ensure that the curriculum framework is designed to meet the eligibility criteria of various Competitive Exams adapting a Coherent and Systematic approach . Mock Tests, Screening Tests and Mock Interviews
                                        are organized on regular basis, to give the students a tough drilling to appear in the Competitive Exams. Previous Years Question Papers are attempted by the aspirants and follow up work is also monitored by the
                                        teachers to ensure that ample practice is taken up by them. Group Discussions and Debating Sessions are a customary feature to augment communication skills of the aspirants, as we believe that great leaders need
                                        to be great orators as well. One- to- one Counseling Sessions are taken up to bring about clarity and transparency in the cadets as far as their choices, doubts and caliber is concerned. Training modules are designed
                                        explicitly keeping in sync with the ground-breaking techniques which are the need of the hour. No stone is left unturned to shape up the personality of the cadets in such a manner that the nation feels proud of
                                        them. This all makes us stand apart from the others as we believe in updating ourselves with the ever changing times, while staying rooted to the ground. </p>
